# Task Content ::
- The task consists of two subtasks : Thresholding & segmentation  

## 1- Thresholding:
In computer vision,  thresholding  is a fundamental tool for segmentation  of  grey level images when  objects and background pixels can be distinguished by  their grey level values.

A- **Optimal Threshold**:

 - used to separate the object and background pixels of the image to improve the quality of low contrast images
### Results :

  ---------------

B- **Otsu Threshold**:

- is used to perform automatic image thresholding.In the simplest form, the algorithm returns a single intensity threshold that separate pixels into two classes, foreground and background. This threshold is determined by minimizing intra-class intensity variance, or equivalently, by maximizing inter-class variance. Otsu's method is a one-dimensional discrete analog of Fisher's Discriminant Analysis.

### Results :

C- **Spectral Threshold**:

- spectral (or multilevel) threshold is proposed for segmenting an image into multiple levels using its mean and variance. Starting from the extreme pixel values at both ends of the histogram plot, the algorithm is applied recursively on sub-ranges computed from the previous step, so as to find a threshold level and a new sub-range for the next step, until no significant improvement in image quality can be achieved.

## 2- Segmentation:

A- **K-Mean**:

is an unsupervised algorithm and it is used to segment the interest area from the background. But before applying K -means algorithm, first partial stretching enhancement is applied to the image to improve the quality of the image. Subtractive clustering method is data clustering method where it generates the centroid based on the potential value of the data points. So subtractive cluster is used to generate the initial centers and these centers are used in k-means algorithm for the segmentation of image.

B- **Mean Shift** :

Mean shift clustering algorithm is a centroid-based algorithm that helps in various use cases of unsupervised learning. It works by shifting data points towards centroids to be the mean of other points in the region. It is also known as the mode seeking algorithm. The algorithmâ€™s advantage is that it assigns clusters to the data without automatically defining the number of clusters based on defined bandwidth.

### Results :

- Original image

C- **Agglomerative method** :
- Agglomerative Clustering is a type of hierarchical clustering algorithm. It is an unsupervised machine learning technique that divides the population into several clusters such that data points in the same cluster are more similar and data points in different clusters are dissimilar.
- Points in the same cluster are closer to each other.
- Points in the different clusters are far apart.

- Steps of Agglomerative Clustering:

    1- Initially, all the data-points are a cluster of its own.

   2- Take two nearest clusters and join them to form one single cluster.

   3- Proceed recursively step 2 until you obtain the desired number of clusters.

### Results :
 (here we use small image size (50x50) beacuse og long computation time)

D- **Region growing** :


- Region growing is a simple region-based image segmentation method. It is also classified as a pixel-based image segmentation method since it involves the selection of initial seed points.
This approach to segmentation examines neighboring pixels of initial seed points and determines whether the pixel neighbors should be added to the region.
- The first step in region growing is to select a set of seed points. Seed point selection is based on some user criterion (for example, pixels in a certain grayscale range, pixels evenly spaced on a grid, etc.).The initial region begins as the exact location of these seeds.The regions are then grown from these seed points to adjacent points depending on a region membership criterion. The criterion could be, for example, pixel intensity, grayscale texture, or colour.
Since the regions are grown on the basis of the criterion, the image information itself is important. For example, if the criterion were a pixel intensity threshold value, knowledge of the histogram of the image would be of use, as one could use it to determine a suitable threshold value for the region membership criterion.
